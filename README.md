### Will my account get banned if I use this tool?

**There have been 2-3 reports from users who received account bans from Spotify for using this tool**.

We recommend using ZSpotify with a burner account. 
Alternatively, there is a configuration option labled ```DOWNLOAD_REAL_TIME```, this limits the download speed to the duration of the song being downloaded thus not appearing suspicious to Spotify.
This option is much slower and is only recommended for premium users who wish to download songs in 320kbps without buying premium on a burner account.

**Use ZSpotify at your own risk**, the developers of ZSpotify are not responsible if your account gets banned.

### What do I do if I see "Your session has been terminated"?

If you see this, don't worry! Just try logging back in. If you see the incorrect username or password error, reset your password and you should be able to log back in and continue using Spotify.

### Options
**likedSongs** - Downloads all the liked songs from your account
